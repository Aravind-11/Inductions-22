ML Algorithms used : K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Random Forest Classifier

Web Framework Used : Flask

  The website gets 4 data from the user - Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width. Using these 4 data the model predicts the species of the flower corresponding to the given data.
  
 The website also has a option to get data from the user to train the model and save it.
