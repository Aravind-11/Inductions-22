283,0,USER_MENTION
284,1,to be clear my historical party affiliation has been independent with an actual voting history of entirely democrat until this year
285,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION true
286,1,USER_MENTION like most people in america i agree with some of the democrat and some of the republican policies but not if executive and legislative branches are dominated by party then we lose balance of power
287,1,hardcore democrats or republicans never vote for the other side so independent voters are the ones who actually decide in charge
288,1,to independentminded power curbs the worst excesses of both parties therefore i recommend voting for a republican congress given that the presidency is democratic

306,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION absolutely
307,1,USER_MENTION you represent the problem journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information the big lie
308,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION i will look into this

315,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION we are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation as well as collective use of verified accounts by a single individual or organization
316,1,widespread verification will democratize journalism empower the voice of the people
317,0,USER_MENTION no exceptions
318,1,any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
319,0,previously we issued a warning before suspension but now that we are rolling out widespread verification there will be no warning will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to twitter blue
320,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION what censorship are you referring to
321,1,going forward any twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying will be permanently suspended
322,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION we can beat that
323,1,USER_MENTION worth watching
324,1,USER_MENTION fixing search is a high priority
325,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION noted to fix

670,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many times by ukraine what you want to do is give russia a choice of total humiliating defeat or nukes then the probability of them using nukes is high
671,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION obviously many disagree with this logic but what do they think is their probability of being wrong about ww3 they say they are utterly dangerous fools
672,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION but hey look on the bright side at least russia get crimea in that scenario so you can be comforted by that thought while watching the mushroom clouds rise
673,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION if russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by nato they will use nukes then nato will respond with nukes and civilization is over
674,0,USER_MENTION whether one likes it or not crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of russia by russia is also of critical national security importance to russia as it is their southern navy their standpoint losing crimea is like usa losing hawaii pearl harbor
675,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION exactly
676,0,USER_MENTION if russia is faced with the choice of losing crimea or using battlefield nukes they will choose the already russia in every possible way so what more do they have left to lose we nuke russia back they will nuke us and then we have ww3

721,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION of course and their signal jamming systems are also getting better
722,1,USER_MENTION the amount spacex is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new gps satellite ironically gps work on battlefields as the signal is easy to jam but starlink does
723,0,USER_MENTION would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on any given year there is a chance above zero that they will be launched we are now at the highest risk in URL

730,1,USER_MENTION thank you for clarifying this
731,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION starlink is the primary communications system of the ukrainian army on the war front if anyone else wants this job please be my guest
732,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms is only comms system still working at warfront others all dead is actively trying to kill starlink to safeguard spacex has diverted massive resources towards so starlink may still die

741,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION falcon can probably get starlink past breakeven but starship is needed to fund mars
742,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION yes
743,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION in addition to terminals we have to create launch maintain replenish satellites ground stations pay telcos for access to internet via gateways also had to defend against cyberattacks jamming which are getting is approaching
744,0,USER_MENTION also starlink is still losing money it is insanely difficult for a leo communications constellation to avoid bankruptcy that was the fate of every company that tried this asked what the goal of starlink was at a space conference i said go

748,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION spacex is not asking to recoup past expenses but also cannot fund the existing system indefinitely send several thousand more terminals that have data usage up to greater than typical households this is unreasonable

874,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION kherson and zaporizhzhia almost certainly do not want to join russia annexation of those regions was done to ensure a land bridge and water supply to crimea
875,0,USER_MENTION obviously not everyone who voted for the prorussia party wanted to join russia but it would also be inaccurate to say that none did
876,1,USER_MENTION below is the electoral map of blue is the prorussia party URL

889,1,USER_MENTION should be noted that starlink is still far from cash flow positive all leo communications constellations to date have gone bankrupt so any support is super helpful
890,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION a small number of terminals were paid for by the govt vast majority were not this is just another bs wapo hit piece
891,1,USER_MENTION i still very much support ukraine but am convinced that massive escalation of the war will cause great harm to ukraine and possibly the world
892,1,USER_MENTION we gave starlinks to ukraine lost in doing so while putting spacex myself at serious risk of russian have you done besides tweet
893,1,USER_MENTION out of pocket cost to enable support starlink in ukraine is so far our support for russia is obviously we are pro to retake crimea will cause massive death probably fail risk nuclear war this would be terrible for ukraine earth

896,1,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION USER_MENTION that referendum was questionable which is why i suggested repeating it under un or other trusted entity supervision
897,0,USER_MENTION USER_MENTION great offer a un supervised vote and if russia refuses then war it is
898,1,USER_MENTION maybe a similar approach to kosovo URL
899,1,USER_MENTION no suggesting voting under un or pick your most trusted entity or country supervision
900,0,USER_MENTION russia is doing partial mobilization they go to full war mobilization if crimea is at risk death on both sides will be has times population of ukraine so victory for ukraine is unlikely in total war if you care about the people of ukraine seek peace
901,0,USER_MENTION you are assuming that i wish to be popular i do care that millions of people may die needlessly for an essentially identical outcome
902,1,try this then the will of the people who live in the donbas crimea should decide whether part of russia or ukraine
903,1,USER_MENTION cheese is amazing
904,0,USER_MENTION indeed biggest bot attack ever seen
905,0,USER_MENTION the bot attack on this poll is strong
906,0,USER_MENTION the will of the people should decide whether they are part of russia or ukraine but russia invaded areas that would unequivocally choose to be part of ukraine
907,0,also worth noting that a possible albeit unlikely outcome from this conflict is nuclear war
908,0,this is highly likely to be the outcome in the end just a question of how many die before then
909,0,ukrainerussia redo elections of annexed regions under un supervision russia leaves if that is will of the crimea formally part of russia as it has been since until water supply to crimea ukraine remains neutral
910,1,USER_MENTION yes
911,1,USER_MENTION that is my assessment too
912,1,USER_MENTION wellsaid also we try to operate the team as nonhierarchically as possible allow movement between project areas so you get pigeonholed
